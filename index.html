            I think lying is a crime. Although people have their own freedom of speech when they speak, the harm they
            can bring to others and society through lies is real.<br> In court, if someone is dishonest, then this kind of
            obstruction of law enforcement will affect the fairness of judicial results. Making false statements to the
            federal government or any government official is a crime.<br> If you tell someone a lie, and the other person
            has difficulties or something bad happens because of the lie, then you have to pay for your lie.<br> 
            When a person tells a lie, most of the time he realizes that what he said is not true. This kind of
            subjective desire to deceive or deceive others, when you defraud someone by lying to them, it is a crime.
