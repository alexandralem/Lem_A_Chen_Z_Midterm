		<h2>Lie is not a Crime</h2>
		<p>Lie is not an offence serious enough to sue people for. Of course, lying to government officials and under oath in court is a crime but all the countless occasions when people lie to each other in their everyday lives cannot be considered crimes as well. Also, there is always such a thing as the human factor. Human's behaviour may be influenced by many different conditions. Moreover, sometimes people lie for the good cause. For example, not to make people they love worry. </p>
