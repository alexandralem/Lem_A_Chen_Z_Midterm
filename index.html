		<h2>Lie is not a Crime</h2>
		<p>Lie is not an offence serious enough to sue people for. Of course, lying to government officials and under oath in court is a crime but all the countless occasions when people lie to each other in their everyday lives cannot be considered crimes as well. Also, there is always such a thing as the human factor. Human's behaviour may be influenced by many different conditions. Moreover, sometimes people lie for the good cause. For example, not to make people they love worry. </p>

            I think lying is a crime. Although people have their own freedom of speech when they speak, the harm they
            can bring to others and society through lies is real.<br> In court, if someone is dishonest, then this kind of
            obstruction of law enforcement will affect the fairness of judicial results. Making false statements to the
            federal government or any government official is a crime.<br> If you tell someone a lie, and the other person
            has difficulties or something bad happens because of the lie, then you have to pay for your lie.<br> 
            When a person tells a lie, most of the time he realizes that what he said is not true. This kind of
            subjective desire to deceive or deceive others, when you defraud someone by lying to them, it is a crime.
